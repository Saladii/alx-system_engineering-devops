# UFW can work managing both IPV4 addresses, enabled by default, and IPV6 if necessary. If you need to also # enable IPV6, modify this option from the file "/ etc / default / ufw". 

# In order to apply this change, open the file with the nano editor:
# Then make sure the value of IPV6 is yes. It should look like this:
# IPV6=yes
sudo nano /etc/default/ufw

# sudo ufw allow http
